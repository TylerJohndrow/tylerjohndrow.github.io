# Project 5: MineWalker

* Author: Tyler Johndrow

## Overview

The program creates a grid of clickable buttons for the user to play with. They begin at start and try to reach the end before running out of 
lives do to the grid containing mines.

## Compiling and Using

To use this program you will just want to run it. There will be a key on the left hand side to let you know how the color work and to show you 
where to start. To use the code click on the start button you will only be able to move from the right and the north to begin with. If you
wish to change the size of the grid you can click text field next to show mines/path. You can change the size any where between 5 and 20.


## Discussion

I had problems at the beginning with getting the layout corrected and with figuring out how to keep the array within bound when try to check
for nearby mines. Creating the buttons and most of the method that were called took me very little time to accomplish what I wanted from them.
To create this program I begun by making a button that would be used to fill the grid. Next I did the prelabs for both of the labs and wrote 
the logic for button on the outside of the panel. Next I begun working on what happen when some clicks on the start button. I did some research
on 2D arrays to see if they had a preset command for checking if value was within bounds. Once learning it didn't I just wrote an if statement 
to with the value being >= 0 and the value being <= grid.length. The most challenging part of this project I would say is dealing with the 
actionlisteners and making sure they are not doing it for the whole board if you didn't write a java file for each panel. I would definitely
say I am a lot better with 2D arrays and guis after working on this project. I believe I would be able to make another beginner level gui after
this project and maybe a little hard of one.

## Testing
To test the program clicked on mines to make sure it was lower lives and score and would end the game when you ran out of lives. Next I tested 
the show mines/path button to make sure it was making a correct amount of mines for the grid size. Tested the jtextfield made sure the grid was
staying a decent size not some crazy size you couldn't see. Last I checked the grid and made sure it would work correctly even at different 
sizes and that if you clicked on a button a second time it wouldn't change the color to something else.
